Project: React Native

Team members: Hannah and Ricards

Project description: During this research week, we have been learning how to use React Native with the goal of finding out what it is, why so many companies use it and to have some hands on experience, as this is a popular framework that we could encounter in the work place. We also wanted to share set up instructions and a basic tutorial with our class mates. 

The set up: you first need create an Expo app (this will help you connect to the actual Expo app so that you can see what you're building on your phone screen.) to do this paste the following code into your terminal: npx create-expo-app@latest --template
Then you will have a choice of templates. To use JavaScript choose "blank"
Once the app has been created run the command: npm start. This will get the server running and will give you an option to open your app on the web, Android, or Iphone. 
If the Expo app on your phone does not connect, you may need to download an emulator, but that's an ordeal in its self. Windows and Linux machines are not compatible with Apple simulator. You will find more information in the docs bellow.

Now you are ready to build your app, follow the tutorial bellow for a quick simple guide.
